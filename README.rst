Description
-----------

People may want to reformat the docstrings in program when:

- Teamworking (need unified docstring style)
- Reviewing othersâ€™ code (prefer familiar docstring style)

Merlion will parse one or several Python scripts and then retrieve the existing docstring. For all found functions/methods/classes with an existing docstring, it will fetch their parameters, default values, type, ...
